As video frame interpolation results often exhibit unique artifacts, existing quality metrics sometimes are not consistent with human perception when measuring the interpolation results. Some recent deep learning-based perceptual quality metrics are shown more consistent with human judgments, but their performance on videos is compromised since they do not consider temporal information. In this project, we present a dedicated perceptual quality metric for measuring video frame interpolation results.

### Network

### Requirements
System: Ubuntu

Pytorch version: >= Pytorch1.10

GPU memory: >= 12G


### Test on BVI-VFI dataset
1. Download the [BVI-VFI](https://danielism97.github.io/BVI-VFI/) dataset. Set the path in the function `get_dataset_dir` in `utils.py`
```python
    elif dataset == 'bvivfi':
        datadir = 'BVI-VFI_DATASET_PATH'
```

2. Run the testing codes
```bash
python test_bvivfi_fast.py --model=multiscale_v33 --expdir=./exp/eccv_ms_multiscale_v33/ --testset=bvivfi
```


### Training 
1. Download the VFIPS dataset (Sorry, we realized that some source videos are deleted by their authors, we are cleaning them. The download link is temporally closed.). Set the path in the function `get_dataset_dir` in `utils.py`
```python
    if dataset == 'vfips':
        datadir = 'VFIPS_DATASET_PATH'
```

2. Run the training codes
```bash
python train.py --model=multiscale_v33 --expdir=./exp/eccv_ms_multiscale_v33/
```
